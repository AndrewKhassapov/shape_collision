A shape collision algorithm for an infinite 2D board of shapes that returns a Dictionary<int, List<int>>() of all intersections between shapes.
Each shape has a unique ID as an integer.
Entry way point is Program.cs
> Return is in the format: [SHAPE ID] => ([SHAPE ID INTERSECTED WITH], ..., [SHAPE ID INTERSECTED WITH])
